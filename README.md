Research in planetary seismology is fundamentally constrained by a lack of data due to the difficulty of transferring high-resolution seismic signals back to Earth. The amount of power required to transmit data scales with distance, so the further a target body is from Earth, the more energy is required to transmit the same amount of data. Quakes are typically rare events, meaning that although large amounts of continuous data are recorded and sent back to Earth, only a small fraction of this data contains useful signals. This constraint is especially important as seismologists will likely be sharing the lander with science teams from other disciplines who have different objectives and instruments, some of which may be transferring even larger amounts of data to Earth. Consequently, data is recorded at lower resolution or with fewer instruments than might be optimal to achieve the desired science.

A potential solution for this issue is to run algorithms on a lander to differentiate seismic data from the noise, so that only the useful signals can be extracted and sent back to Earth. This is tricky to do in practice, as seismic signals on other planets tend to look different than on Earth, and the signal might be only faintly observable in the noise.
